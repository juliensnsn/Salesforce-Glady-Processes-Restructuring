  <h3>Salesforce Glady Process Restructuring</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>1. Workflow Restructuring</strong><br>
    – All Salesforce workflows were restructured for greater efficiency and clarity.<br>
    – Flows were grouped by object and by trigger (Create, Update, Before/After Save).<br>
    – Best practices were implemented to minimize unnecessary processes and reduce costs.<br>
    – Complex flows were split into multiple subflows, each triggered by a single workflow, making maintenance easier.<br>
    – Optimized error management was established to facilitate troubleshooting.<br>
    – Each workflow was documented, with clear descriptions for future reference.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2. User Permissions Restructuring</strong><br>
    – User rights management was shifted from profile-based to permission set-based access.<br>
    – Profiles were reserved for app access, distinguishing between standard users and beta users.<br>
    – Permission sets and permission set groups were optimized for precise and flexible control.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3. Data Privacy Enforcement</strong><br>
    – Data access was moved to a private model.<br>
    – Record-level access was managed through custom hierarchies and sales teams, ensuring both security and operational flexibility.<br>
